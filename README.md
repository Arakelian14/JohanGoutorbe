- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Arakelian on the Internet and beyond.

- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning object oriented software languages such as .NET framework or JAVA and OBJECT ORIENTED PHP languages.
- ðŸŒ± I'm mainly perfecting myself on JavaScript, and I'm having fun creating HTML5-CSS3 web pages with a maximum of PHP embedded in the code, and JavaScript to automate my pages.
